              This is a man named Joel. Joel liked many things. One day, he
              decided to watch a Movie. After that, he was hooked. He couldn't
              get enough of movies. He started to keep a list of movies that he
              liked. Tens turned into hundreds into thousands. Sooner than
              later, he had to sell his house to keep up with his movie watching
              hobby. Because of Joel's donated time, we are able to have this
              information for your leisure. Stay safe and enjoy.
